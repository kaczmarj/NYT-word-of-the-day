# NYT Words of the Day

This is a list of 2,378 words from
[https://www.nytimes.com/column/learning-word-of-the-day](NYT Word of the Day) from
Oct. 17, 2009 to Nov. 30, 2021.

The [original list is available here](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/vocabulary-video-contest-2021-word-list/8dd26e74fef8fe88/full.pdf).

Use this list with programs like `PyDictionary` to get the meanings of the words.

My intention is to (one day) create electronic flash cards of these words and their meanings.
